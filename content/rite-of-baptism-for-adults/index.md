# About

There are a number of variables possible for a baptism; to name several: age, number of those to be baptized, gender, how many ceremonies have been performed already, if it is unclear if baptism has been performed already, if a bishop is performing the baptism. 

The Latin text below is directly from the _Rituale Romanum_[^1], with some of the options removed for clarity. 

The English text below is from Philip T. Weller's translation of the _Rituale Romanum_[^2], with some of the options and the commentary removed for clarity.

# Overview 

From the Roman Ritual[^2]: 

> The first stage deals with the spiritual preparation to be made by the priest in charge of instructing the catechumens as well as by the faithful. These prayers, by emphasizing what a serious matter Christian life is, will prove to be a spiritual help to the catechumens (nos. 1- 3). This part is followed by the formal roll call, the basic instruction, the act of turning away from error and turning to God, and the first solemn signing with the cross (nos. 4-12), which is also the basic exorcism or the radical deliverance from the power of evil spirits. The second stage deals with the very ancient ceremony of administering blessed salt, which symbolizes the catechumens' ever growing delight in the Christian religion (nos. 13-17). 

> The third, fourth, and fifth stages embody the solemn, thrice repeated exorcisms, which forcefully impress on the catechumens how much effort is entailed in total conversion to God, and how the devil, the adversary of mankind, opposes it with all his might (nos 18-24; 25-31; 32-40).

> The sixth stage has the ceremonies directly preparatory to baptism, ceremonies derived from very ancient use and filled with profound significance. They consist of the solemn procession of the candidates into church (nos. 41-42), followed by the recitation of the Creed and the Lord's Prayer, the final exorcism, and the rite called "opening of ears"; lastly, another renunciation of Satan, the anointing with oil of catechumens, which makes a person a warrior against the enemies of Christ and the Church (nos. 47-49).

> The seventh and last stage leads up to baptism proper. It consists of another roll call, the profession of faith, the request for baptism (nos. 51-52), the act of baptizing (nos. 53-55), the anointing with chrism, which suggests the grace of the Holy Spirit received in baptism (no. 55), the bestowal of the baptismal robe and the lighted candle (nos. 56-57), and the dismissal of the baptized (no. 58).

# Easter Vigil 

The Roman Ritual advises that adult baptisms should take place during the Vigil of Easter, or the Vigil of Pentecost. Of the seven stages mentioned above, typically 1-6 are done before the Vigil, and stage 7 is done at the Vigil. 

There has been growing awareness that Holy Week was dramatically revised in 1955. Some traditional parishes and locations may celebrate the pre-1955 Holy Week, and some may celebrate the 1962 Holy Week. 

For the texts, propers, and commentaries on the pre-55 Holy Week, visit Pre-1955 Holy Week Resources[^7]. Their website has many full-text resources on the pre-55 Easter Vigil, as well as differences between the pre-55 and 1962 rites. 

# Ordo Baptismi Adultorum 

1\. In primis Sacerdos, paratis his, quae supra de observandis in administratione Sacramenti Baptismi Parvulorum dicuntur, indutus superpelliceo et stola, vel etiam pluviali violacei coloris, cum suis Clericis accedit ad gradus Altaris, et genibus flexis, pias mente ad Deum praeces effundit, ut tantum Sacramentum digne valeat ministrare; et ad implorandum divinum auxilium, surgens, se signat, et si temporis ratio ferat, dicit: 

S: **Deus in adjutorium meum intende.** 

Respondet: **Domine, ad adjuvandum me festina.** 

S: **Gloria Patri.**

R: **Sicut erat.**

2\. Postae incipiat, prosequentibus Clericis: 

Ant. **Effundam super vos aquam mundam, et mundabimini ab omnibus inquinamentis vestris, dicit Dominus.** 

## Psalmus 8. 

**Domine Dominus noster, * quam admirabile est nomen tuum in universa terra!** 

**Quoniam elevata est magnificentia tua, * super caelos.** 

**Ex ore infantium et lactentium perfecisti laudem propter inimicos tuos, * ut destruas inimicum et ultorem.** 

**Quoniam videbo caelos tuos, opera digitorum tuorum: * lunam et stellas, quae tu fundasti.** 

**Quid est homo, quod memor es ejus? * aut filius hominis, quoniam visitas eum?** 

**Minuisti eum paulo minus ab Angelis, gloria et honore coronasti eum: * et constituisti eum super opera manuum tuarum.** 

**Omnia subjecisti sub pedibus ejus, * oves et boves universas: insuper et pecora campi.** 

**Volucres caeli, et pisces maris, * qui perambulant semitas maris.** 

**Domine Dominus noster, * quam admirabile est nomen tuum in universa terra!** 

**Gloria Patri, etc.** 

## Psalmus 28. 

**Afferte Domino filii Dei: * afferte Domino filios arietum:** 

**Alferte Domino gloriam et honorem, afferte Domino gloriam nomini ejus: * adorate Dominum in atrio sancto ejus.** 

**Vox Domini super aquas, Deus majestatis intonuit: * Dominus super aquas multas.**

**Vox Domini in virtute: * vox Domini in magnificentia.** 

**Vox Domini confringentis cedros: * et confringet Dominus cedros Libani.**

**Et comminuet eas tamquam vitulum Libani: * et dilectus quemadmodum filius unicornium.**

**Vox Domini intercidentis flammam ignis: * vox Domini concutientis desertum: et commovebit Dominus desertum Cades.**

**Vox Domini praeparantis cervos, et revelabit condensa: * et in templo ejus omnes dicent gloriam.** 

**Dominus diluvium inhabitare facit: * et sedebit Dominus Rex in aeternum.**

**Dominus virtutem populo suo dabit: * Dominus benedicet populo suo in pace.**

**Gloria Patri, etc.**

## Psalmus 41. 

**Quemadmodum desiderat cervus ad fontes aquarum: * ita desiderat anima mea ad te Deus.** 

**Sitivit anima mea ad Deum fortem, vivum: * quando veniam, et apparebo ante faciem Dei?**
 
**Fuerunt milii lacrymae meae panes die ac nocte: * dum dicitur mihi quotidie: Ubi est Deus tuus?**
 
**Haec recordatus sum, et effudi in me animam meam: * quoniam transibo in locum tabernaculi admirabilis, usque ad domum Dei.**

**In voce exsultationis, et confessioniS: * sonus epulantis.** 

**Quare tristis es anima mea? * et quare conturbas me?** 

**Spera in Deo, quoniam adhuc confitebor illi: * salutare vultus mei, et Deus meus.** 

**Ad meipsum anima mea conturbata est: * propterea memor ero tui de terra Jordanis, et Hermoniim a monte modico.**

**Abyssus abyssum invocat, * in voce cataractarum tuarum.** 

**Omnia excelsa tua, et fluctus tui * super me transierunt.** 

**In die mandavit Dominus misericordiam suam: * et nocte canticum ejus.**

**Apud me oratio Deo vitae meae, * dicam Deo: Susceptor meus es.** 

**Quare oblitus es mei? * et quare contristatus incedo, dum affligit me inimicus?** 

**Dum confringuntur ossa mea, * exprobraverunt mihi, qui tribulant me, inimici mei.** 

**Dum dicunt mihi per singulos dieS: Ubi est Deus tuus? * quare tristis es anima mea? et quare conturbas me?**

**Spera in Deo, quoniam adhuc confitebor illi: * salutare vultus mei, et Deus meus.**

**Gloria Patri, etc.**

Et repetitur Antiphona. **Effundam super vos aquam mundam, et mundabimini ab omnibus inquinamentis vestris, dicit Dominus.** 

3\. Deinde dicitur: **Kyrie eleison. Christe eleison. Kyrie eleison. Pater noster.** 

S: **Et ne nos indiicas in tentationem.**

R: **Sed libera nos a malo.** 

S: **Domine exaudi orationem meam.** 

R: **Et clamor meus ad te veniat.** 

S: **Dominus vobiscum.** 

R: **Et cum spiritu tuo.** 

**Oremus. Omnipotens, sempiterne Deus, qui dedisti famulis tuis in confessione verae fidei, aeternae Trinitatis gloriam agnoscere; et in potentia majestatis adorare unitatem: quaesumus; ut ejusdem fidei firmitate, ab omnibus semper muniamur adversis. Adesto supplicationibus nostris, omnipotens DeuS: et quod humilitatis nostrae gerendum est ministerio, tuse virtutis impleatur effectu. Da, quaesumus Domine, Electo nostro, ut sanctis edoctus mysteriis, et renovetur fonte Baptismatis, et inter Ecclesiae tuae membra numeretur. Per Christum Dominum nostrum.** 

R: **Amen.**

(â€¦) 5\. Deinde Sacerdos procedit ad fores Ecclesiae, et stat in limine: catechizandus vero extra limen. Et si sunt plures, mares et feminae, illi ad dexteram Sacerdotis, hae vero ad sinistram statuantur, et Sacerdos interrogat: **Quo nomine vocaris?** 

Catechumenus respondet: **N.** 

Sacerdos: **N. Quid petis ab Ecclesia Dei?** 

R: **Fidem.** 

Sacerdos: **Fides, quid tibi praestat?** 

R: **Vitam seternam.**

Sacerdos: Si vis habere vitam seternam, serva mandata. Diliges Dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, et ex tota anima tua, et ex tota mente tua, et proximum tuum sicut te ipsum. In his duobus mandatis tota Lex pendet, et Prophetae. Fides autem est, ut unum Deum in Trinitate, et Trinitatem in unitate venereris, neque confundendo personas, neque substantiam separando. Alia est enim persona Patris, alia Filii, alia Spiritus sancti; sed horum trium una est substantia, et nonnisi una Divinitas. 

6\. Et rursus interrogat: **N. Abrenuntias satanae?**

R: **Abrenuntio.** 

Interrogat: **Et omnibus operibus ejus?** 

R: **Abrenuntio.** 

Interrogat: **Et omnibus pompis ejus?** 

R: **Abrenuntio.** 

7\. Deinde Sacerdos interrogat de Symbolo Fidei, dicens: **Credis in Deum Patrem omnipotentem, Creatorem caeli et terrae?** 

R: **Credo.** 

Interrogat: **Credis in Jesum Christum, Filium ejus unicum, Dominum nostrum, natum, et passum?** 

R: **Credo.** 

Interrogat: **Credis et in Spiritum sanctum, sanctam Ecclesiam Catholicam, Sanctorum communionem, remissionem peccatorum, carnis resurrectionem, et vitam aeternam?** 

R: **Credo.** 

8\. Tunc Sacerdos exsufflat ter in faciem ejus, semel dicens: **Exi ab eo spiritus immunde, et da locum Spiritui sancto Paraclito.** 

9\. Hic in modum crucis halet in faciem ipsius, et dicat: **N. Accipe Spiritum bonum per istam insufflationem, et Dei benedictionem.** 

S: **Pax tibi.** 

R: **Et cum spiritu tuo.** 

10\. Deinde facit Crucem cum pollice in ejus fronte, et in pectore, dicens: **N. Accipe signum Crucis tam in fronte, quam in corde: sume fidem caelestium praeceptorum. Talis esto moribus, ut templum Dei jam esse possiS: ingressusque Ecclesiam Dei, evasisse te laqueos mortis, laetus agnosce; (horresce idola, respue simulacra), cole Deum Patrem omnipotentem, et Jesum Christum, Filium ejus unicum, Dominum nostrum, qui venturus est judicare vivos et mortuos, et saeculum per ignem.**

R: **Amen.** 

(â€¦) 11\. Si plures sunt Electi, omnia supradicta dicantur singillatin super singulos. **Oremus. Te deprecor, Domine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aeterne Deus: ut huic famulo tuo N., qui in hujus saeculi nocte vagatur incertus ac dubius, viam veritatis et agnitionis tuae jubeas demonstrari: quatenus, reseratis oculis cordis sui, te unum Deum Patrem in Filio, et Filium in Patre cum Spiritu sancto recognoscat, atque hujus confessionis fructum, et hic, et in futuro Saeculo percipere mereatur. Per Christum Dominum nostrum.** 

R: **Amen.** 

(â€¦) 13\. Deinde signet Electum signo Crucis cum pollicc in fronte dicens: **Signo tibi frontem, ut suscipias Crucem Domini.** 

In auribus: **Signo tibi aures, ut audias divina praecepta.**

In oculis: **Signo tibi oculos, ut videas claritatem Dei.**

In naribus: S**igno tibi nares, ut odorem suavitatis Christi sentias.** 

In ore: **Signo tibi os, ut loquaris verba vitae.** 

In pectore: **Signo tibi pectus, ut credas in Deum.** 

In scapulis: **Signo tibi scapulas, ut suscipias jugum servitutis ejus.** 

In toto corpore, illud non tangens, manu producit **signum Crucis, et dicit: Signo te totum in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus sancti, ut habeas vitam aeternam, et vivas in saecula saeculorum.** 

R: **Amen.** 

**Oremus. Preces nostras, quaesumus Domine, clementer exaudi, et hunc Electum tuum N. Crucis Dominicae, cujus impressione eum signamus, virtute custodi: ut magnitudinis gloriae tuae rudimenta servans, per custodiam mandatorum tuorum ad regenerationis gloriam pervenire mereatur. Per Christum Dominum nostrum.** 

R: **Amen. 

Oremus. Deus, qui humani generis ita es conditor, ut sis etiam reformator, propitiare populis adoptivis, et novo testamento sobolem novae prolis adscribe: ut filii promissionis, quod non potuerunt assequi per naturam, gaudeant suscepisse per gratiam. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. 

R: **Amen.** 

14\. Tunc imponit manum super caput Electi, et dicit: **Oremus. Omnipotens, sempiterne Deus, Pater Domini nostri Jesu Christi, respicere digneris super hunc famulum tuum N., quem ad rudimenta fidei vocare dignatus eS: omnem caecitatem cordis ab eo expelle: disrumpe omnes laqueos satanae, quibus fuerat colligatus; aperi ei, Domine, januam pietatis tuae, ut signo sapientiae tuae imbutus, omnium cupiditatum foetoribus careat, et ad suavem odorem praeceptorum tuorum laetus tibi in Ecclesia tua deserviat, et proficiat de die in diem, ut idoneus efficiatur accedere ad gratiam Baptismi tui, percepta medicina. Per eumdem Christum Dominum nostrum.** 

R: **Amen.** 

(â€¦) 16\. Deinde Sacerdos benedicit sal. 

## Benedictio Salis dandi Catechumeno 

**Exorcizo te, creatura salis, in nomine Dei Patris omnipotentis, et in caritate Domini nostri Jesu Christi, et in virtute Spiritus sancti. Exorcizo te per Deum vivum, per Deum verum, per Deum sanctum, per Deum, qui te ad tutelam humani generis procreavit, et populo venienti ad credulitatem per servos suos consecrari praecepit, ut in nomine sanctae Trinitatis efficiaris salutare sacramentum ad effugandum inimicum. Proinde rogamus te, Domine, Deus noster, ut hanc creaturam salis sanctificando sanctifices, et benedicendo benedicas, ut fiat omnibus accipientibus perfecta medicina, permanens in visceribus eorum, in nomine ejusdem Domini nostri Jesu Christi, qui venturus est judicare vivos et mortuos, et saeculum per ignem.** 

R: **Amen.** 

17\. Tunc pollice et indice accipit de ipso sale, et immittit in os Catechumeni, dicens: **N. Accipe sal sapientiae: propitiatio sit tibi in vitam aeternam.** 

R: **Amen.** 

Sacerdos: **Pax tibi.** 

R: **Et cum spiritu tuo.** 

Oremus. **Deus patrum nostrorum, Deus universae conditor veritatis, te supplices exoramus, ut hunc famulum tuum N. respicere digneris propitius, et hoc (primum) pabulum salis gustantem, non diutius esurire permittas, quo minus cibo expleatur caelesti, quatenus sit semper spiritu fervens, spe gaudens, tuo semper nomini serviens (Perduc eum, Domine quaesumus, ad novae regenerationis lavacrum), ut cum fidelibus tuis promissionum tuarum aeterna praemia consequi mereatur. Per Christum Dominum nostrum.** 

R: **Amen.** 

(â€¦) 21\. Deinde Sacerdos dicat super masculum tantum: Ora, Electe, flecte genua, et dic: **Pater noster.** 

Et Electus genu flexo orat, et dicit: **Pater noster. Et cum oraverit, et dixerit Pater noster**, usque ad Sed libera nos a malo, inclusive.

Sacerdos subjungit: **Leva, comple orationem tuam, et dic, Amen.** 

Et ille respondet: **Amen.** 

Et Sacerdos dicit Patrino: **Signa eum.** 

Deinde Electo: **Accede.** 

Et Patrinus pollice signat cum in fronte, dicens: **In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus sancti.** 

22\. Tum quoque Sacerdos facil crucem in fronte ejus, ita dicendo: **In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus sancti.** 

Et imponit manum super eum, et dicit: **Oremus. Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac, Deus Jacob, Deus, qui Moysi famulo tuo in monte Sinai apparuisti, et filios Israel de terra Aegypti eduxisti, deputans eis Angelum pietatis tuae, qui custodiret eos die ac nocte: te, quaesumus Domine; ut mittere digneris sanctum Angelum tuum de caelis, qui similiter custodiat et hunc famulum tuum N. et perducat eum ad gratiam Baptismi tui. Per Christum Dominum nostrum.**

R: **Amen.** 

## Exorcismus

**Ergo, maledicte diabole, recognosce sententiam tuam, et da honorem Deo vivo et vero, da honorem Jesu Christo Filio ejus, et Spiritui sancto, et recede ab hoc famulo Dei N. quia istum sibi Deus et Dominus noster Jesus Christus ad suam sanctam gratiam, fontemque Baptismatis vocare dignatus est: et hoc signum sanctae crucis, quod nos fronti ejus damus, tu, maledicte diabole, numquam audeas violare. Per eumdem Christum Dominum nostrum, qui venturus est judicare vivos et mortuos, et saeculum per ignem.** 

R: Amen. 

23\. Sed si plures sint Catechumenii, hic et in sequentibus Sacerdos dicat in numero plurali: **Orate, Electi, flectite genua, etc.**, ut supra, usque ad finem praecedentis Exorcismi, qui incipit: **Ergo, maledicte diabole**. Item super unum secundo dicat: **Ora, Electe, flecte genua, et dic: Pater noster**, et reliqua, ut supra pag. 29, usque ad **Orationem, Deus Abraham** exclusive: deinde imponit manum super eum, ac dicit: **Oremus. Deus immortale praesidium omnium postulantium, liberatio supplicum, pax rogantium, vita credentium, resurrectio mortuorum: te invoco super hunc famulum tuum N., qui Baptismi tui donum petens, aeternam consequi gratiam spirituali regeneratione desiderat: accipe eum Domine, et quia dignatus es dicere: Petite, et accipietis; quaerite, et invenietis; pulsate, et aperietur vobis: petenti praemium porrige, et januam pande pulsanti; ut aeternam caelestis lavacri benedictionem consecutus, promissa tui muneris regna percipiat. Qui cum Patre, et Spiritu sancto vivis et regnas Deus, in saecula saeculorum.** 

R: Amen. 

## Exorcismus 

**Audi, maledicte satana, adjuratus per nomen aeterni Dei, et Salvatoris nostri Jesu Christi Filii ejus, cum tua victus invidia, tremens, gemensque discede: nihil tibi sit commune cum servo Dei N., jam caelestia cogitante, renuntiaturo tibi et saeculo tuo, et beatae immortalitati victuro. Da igitur honorem advenienti Spiritui sancto, qui ex summa caeli arce descendens, proturbatis fraudibus tuis, divino fonte purgatum pectus, sanctificatum Deo templum et habitaculum (perficiat): ut ab omnibus penitus noxiis praeteritorum criminum liberatus servus Dei, gratias perennes Deo referat semper, et benedicat nomen sanctum ejus in saecula saeculorum.** 

R: Amen. 

24\. Item super unum masculum tertio dicat ut supra: **Ora, Electe, flecte genua, et dic: Pater noster, etc.**, usque ad **Orationem, Deus Abraham** exclusive. Deinde imponit manum snper eum, dicens: 

### Exorcismus

**Exorcizo te, immunde spiritus, in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus sancti, ut exeas, et recedas ab hoc famulo Dei N. Ipse enim tibi imperat, maledicte damnate, qui pedibus super mare ambulavit, et Petro mergenti dexteram porrexit.** 

(â€¦) 29\. Super utrumque, sive masculum, sive feminam imponit manum super caput ejus, et dicit: **Oremus. Aeternam ac justissimam pietatem tuam deprecor, Domine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aeterne Deus, auctor luminis et veritatis, super hunc famulum tuum N., ut digneris eum illuminare lumine intelligentiae tuae: munda eum, et sanctifica: da ei scientiam veram efficiatur accedere ad gratiam Baptismi tui, teneat firmam spem, consilium rectum, doctrinam sanctam, ut aptus sit ad percipiandam gratiam tuam.) Per Christum Dominum nostrum.** 

R: **Amen.** 

(â€¦) 31\. Hic peractis, Sacerdos sinistra manu apprehendens dexteram Electi prope brachium, vel ei porrigens extremam partem stolae, introducit eum in Ecclesiam dicens: **N. Ingredere in sanctam Ecclesiam Dei, ut accipias benedictionem caelestem a Domino Jesu Christo, et habeas partem cum illo, et Sanctis ejus.** 

R: **Amen.** 

(â€¦) 33\. Et ingressus Electus procumbit, seu prosternit se in pavimento, et adorat. 

34. Deinde surgit, et Sacerdos imponit manum super caput ejus, et Electus cum eo recitat Symbolum Apostolorum, et Orationem Dominicam. 

35\. Ita etiam si plures fuerint, omnes surgunt, et simul recitant: **Credo in Deum, Patrem omnipotentem, Creatorem cÃ¦li et terrÃ¦. Et in Iesum Christum, Filium eius unicum, Dominum nostrum: qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria Virgine, passus sub Pontio Pilato, crucifixus, mortuus, et sepultuS: descendit ad inferos; tertia die resurrexit a mortuis; ascendit ad cÃ¦los; sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris omnipotentis; inde venturus est iudicare vivos et mortuos. Credo in Spiritum Sanctum, sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam, Sanctorum communionem, remissionem peccatorum, carnis resurrectionem, vitam Ã¦ternam.**

R: **Amen.** 

**Pater noster, qui es in cÃ¦lis, sanctificetur nomen tuum. Adveniat regnum tuum. Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in cÃ¦lo, et in terra. Panem nostrum cotidianum da nobis hodie. Et dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris. Et ne nos inducas in tentationem: sed libera nos a malo.**

R: **Amen.** 

36\. Tunc rursus Sacerdos imponat manum super caput Electi, et dicat: 

## Exorcismus

**Nec te latet, satana, imminere tibi poenas, imminere tibi tormenta, imminere tibi diem judicii, diem supplicii sempiterni; diem, qui venturus est velut clibanus ardens, in quo tibi, atque universis angelis tuis praeparatus sempiternus erit interitus. Proinde damnate, atque damnande, da honorem Deo vivo et vero, da honorem Jesu Christo Filio ejus, da honorem Spiritui sancto Paraclito, in cujus nomine atque virtute praecipio tibi, quicumque es, spiritus immunde, ut exeas, et recedas ab hoc famulo Dei N., quem hodie idem Deus et Dominus noster Jesus Christus ad suam sanctam gratiam et benedictionem, fontemque Baptismatis dono vocare dignatus est (ut fiat) ejus templum per aquam regenerationis in remissionem omnium peccatorum. In nomine ejusdem Domini nostri Jesu Christi, qui venturus est judicare vivos et mortuos, et saeculum per ignem.** 

R: Amen. 

(â€¦) 38\. Postea Sacerdos pollice accipit de saliva oris sui, et tangit aures, et nares Electi; tangendo vero aurem dexteram et sinistram, dicat: **Ephpheta, quod est, Adaperire**; deinde tangendo nares, dicat: **In odorem suavitatis. Et subdit: Tu autem effugare, diabole; appropinquabit enim judicium Dei.** 

39. Deinde interroget Electum: **Quis vocaris?** 

Et ipse respondet: **N.** 

Interroget: **N. Abrenuntias satanae?** 

R: **Abrenuntio.** 

Interroget: **Et omnibus operibus ejus?** 

R: **Abrenuntio.** 

Interroget: **Et omnibus pompis ejus?** 

R: **Abrenuntio.** 

40\. Tunc Sacerdos intingit pollicem dexterae manus in Oleo sancto Catechumenorum, et inungit Electum primum in pectore, deinde inter scapulas, in modum crucis, dicens: **Ego te linio oleo salutis in Christo Jesu Domino nostro in vitam aeternam.** 

R: **Amen.** 

Sacerdos: **Pax tibi.** 

R: **Et cum spiritu tuo.** 

41\. Mox bombacio, vel re simili tergit pollicem, et loca inuncta, et subjungit, dicens: **Exi immunde spiritus, et da honorem Deo vivo et vero. Fuge immunde spiritus, et da locum Jesu Christo Filio ejus. Recede immunde spiritus, et da locum Spiritui sancto Paraclito.** 

42\. Sacerdos interrogat: **Quis Vocaris?**

Respondet: **N.**

43\. Interrogat: **N. Credis in Deum Patrem omnipotentem, creatorem caeli et terrae?** 

R: **Credo.** 

Interrogat: **Credis in Jesum Christum, Filium ejus unicum, Dominum nostrum, natum, et passum?** 

R: **Credo.** 

Interrogat: **Credis et in Spiritum sanctum, sanctam Ecclasiam catholicam, Sanctorum communionem, remissionem peccatorum, carnis resurrectionem, et vitam aeternam?** 

R: **Credo.** 

Iterum interrogat, dicens: **N. Quid petis?** 

Respondet: **Baptismum.** 

Interrogat: **Vis baptizari?** 

Respondet: **Volo.** 

44\. Tunc Patrino, vel Matrina, vel utroque (si ambo admittantur), admota manu, tenente seu tangente Electum, vel Electam, aperto capite, et laxatis a collo voslibus, inclinatum, Sacerdos vasculo vel urceolo hauriat Aquaro baptismalem de Fonte, et cum ea sub trina supracaput in modum crucis infusione baptizet Electum, seo Electam, in nomine Ss. Trinitatis, sic dicens: **. Ego te baptizo in n6mine Patris**, fundat primo; **et Filii**, fundat secundo; **et Spiritus sancti**, fundat tertio. 

45\. Si Aqua, quae ex capite baptizati defluit, non dilabitur in sacrarium Raptisterii, recipiatur in subjecta aliqua pelvi, et in illud postmodum projiciatur. Cum plures sunt Electi, singillatim singuli interrogantur, et baptizantur, ut supra. Si sunt mares et femina, primum mares, deinde feminae. 

Verum si probabiliter dubitetur, an Electus fuerit alias baptizatus, dicnt Sacerdos: **Si non es baptizatus, ego te baptizo in n6mine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus sancti.** 

46\. Deinde Sacerdos intingat pollicem dexterum in sacrum Chrisma, et perungat verticem Electi in modum crucis, dicens: **Deus omnipotens, Pater Domini nostri Jesu Christi, qui te regeneravit ex aqua et Spiritu sancto, quique dedit tibi remissionem omnium peccatorum, ipse te liniat Chrismate salutis in eodem Christo Jesu Domino nostro in vitam aeternam.** 

R: **Amen.** 

Sacerdos: **Pax tecum.** 

R: **Et cum spiritu tuo.** 

47\. Tunc bombacio vel le simili pollicem tergit, et imponit capiti Electi chrismale, seu candidum linteolum, et dat illi vestem candidam, dicens: **Accipe vestem candidam et immaculatam, quam perferas ante tribunal Domini nostri Jesu Christi, ut habeas vitam aeternam.** 

R: **Amen.** 

48\. Et Electus deponit priores vestos, et induitur novis albi coloris, vel saltem exteriore candida, quam a Sacerdote accepit. 

Postea dat ei Sacerdos cereum, seu candelam accensam in manu dextera, dicenS: Accipe lampadem ardentem, et irreprehensibilis custodi Baptismum tuum: serva Dei mandata, ut cum Dominus venerit ad nuptias, possis occurrere ei in aula caelesti in vitam aeternam. 
R: Amen.

1\. The priest, vested in surplice and purple stole or even a cope of the same color, comes to the altar steps with his assistants. He kneels and implores God's help, after which he rises, signs himself with the cross, and says:

Priest: **God, come to my rescue.**

All: **Lord, make haste to help me.**

P: **Glory be to the Father.**

All: **As it was in the beginning.**

2\. Then he intones the antiphon which is continued by the assistants:

Antiphon: **I will pour out on you pure water, and you shall be cleansed of all your stains, says the Lord.**

If possible he sings or recites the following alternately with all who are present:

All: Ant. **I will pour out * on you pure water, and you shall be cleansed of all your stains, says the Lord.**

P: **O Lord, our Lord, how glorious is your majesty over all the earth! * you have exalted your majesty above the heavens.**

All: **Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have fashioned praise because of your foes, * to silence the hostile and the vengeful.**

P: **When I behold your heavens, the work of your fingers, * the moon and the stars which you set in place.**

All: **What is man that you should be mindful of him, * or the son of man that you should care for him?**

P: **You have made him little less than the angels, * and crowned him with glory and honor.**

All: **You have given him rule over the works of your hands, * putting all things under his feet:**

P: **All sheep and oxen, * yes, and the beasts of the field,**

All: **The birds of the air, the fishes of the sea, * and whatever swims the paths of the seas.**

P: **O Lord, our Lord, * how glorious is your name over all the earth!**

All: **Glory be to the Father.**

P: **As it was in the beginning.**

### Psalm 28

P: **Give to the Lord, you sons of God, * give to the Lord glory and praise,**

All: **Give to the Lord the glory due His name; * adore the Lord in holy attire.**

P: **The voice of the Lord is over the waters, the God of glory thunders, * the Lord, over vast waters.**

All: **The voice of the Lord is mighty; * the voice of the Lord is majestic.**

P: **The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars, * the Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon.**

All: **He makes Lebanon leap like a calf * and Sarion like a young wild bull.**

P: **The voice of the Lord strikes fiery flames; the voice of the Lord shakes the desert, * the Lord shakes the wilderness of Cades.**

All: **The voice of the Lord twists the oaks and strips the forests, * and in His temple all say, "Glory!"**

P: **The Lord is enthroned above the flood; * the Lord is enthroned as king forever.**

All: **May the Lord give strength to His people; * may the Lord bless his people with peace.**

P: **Glory be to the Father.**

All: **As it was in the beginning.**

### Psalm 41

P: **As the hind longs for the running waters, * so my soul longs for you, O God.**

All: **Athirst is my soul for God, the living God. * When shall I go and behold the face of God?**

P: **My tears are my food day and night, * as they say to me day after day, "Where is your God?"**

All: **Those times I recall, now that I pour out my soul within me, when I went with the throng * and led them in procession to the house of God.**

P: **Amid loud cries of joy and thanksgiving, * with the multitude keeping festival.**

All: **Why are you so downcast, O my soul? * Why do you sigh within me?**

P: **Hope in God! For I shall again be thanking him, * my Savior and my God.**

All: **My soul is downcast within me; * so will I remember you from the land of the Jordan and of Hermon, from Mount Misar.**

P: **Deep calls unto deep in the roar of your cataracts; * all your breakers and your billows pass over me.**

All: **By day the Lord bestows His grace, * and at night I have His song, a prayer to my living God.**

P: **I sing to God, "My Rock, why do you forget me? * Why must I go about in mourning, with the enemy oppressing me?"**

All: **It crushes my bones that my foes mock me, * as they say to me day after day, "Where is your God?"**

P: **Why are you so downcast, O my soul? * Why do you sigh within me?**

All: **Hope in God! For I shall again be thanking Him, * my Savior and my God.**

P: **Glory be to the Father.**

All: **As it was in the beginning.**

Repeat the antiphon: **I will pour out on you pure water, * and you shall be cleansed of all your stains, says the Lord.**

3\. Then he says: **Lord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Our Father** (the rest inaudibly until:)

P: **And lead us not into temptation.**

All: **But deliver us from evil.**

P: **Lord, heed my prayer.**

All: **And let my cry be heard by you.**

P: **The Lord be with you.**

All: **May He also be with you.**

P: **Let us pray. Almighty, everlasting God, who enable us, your servants, in our profession of the true faith, to acknowledge the glory of the three Persons in the eternal Godhead, and to adore their oneness of nature, their co-equal majesty; grant, we pray, that by steadfastness in that faith we may ever be guarded against all adversity. Hear our prayer, almighty God, so that what we purpose to do by our lowly ministry may have its full effect by your power. We beg you, O Lord, grant that our chosen one (ones), well instructed in the holy mysteries, may be born again in the font of baptism and be added to the household of your Church; through Christ our Lord.**

All: **Amen.**

4\. Next the priest calls the candidates by their full name, first the men then the women, and each one answers **"Present."** Afterward he puts these questions to them:

P: **What are you asking of God's church?**

All: **Faith.**

P: **What does faith hold out to you?**

All: **Everlasting life.**

P: **If, then, you wish to inherit everlasting life, keep the commandments, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself." On these two commandments depend the whole law and the prophets. Now faith demands that you worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in unity, neither confusing the Persons one with the other, nor making a distinction in their nature. For the Father is a distinct Person, so also the Son, so also the Holy Spirit; yet all Three possess the one nature, the one Godhead.**

5. He questions them further, with all giving the answers together, each one for himself in the singular forms:

P: **Do you renounce Satan?**

All: **I do renounce him.**

P: **And all his works?**

All: **I do renounce them.**

P: **And all his attractions?**

All: **I do renounce them.**

6\. Next the priest questions them on the Creed, saying:

P: **Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth?**

All: **I do believe.**

P: **Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was born into this world and suffered for us?**

All: **I do believe.**

P: **Do you also believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?**

All: **I do believe.**

7\. The priest thrice blows softly in their face, and follows up the gesture with the words below, saying them only once: **Depart from them, unclean spirit, and give place to the Holy Spirit, the Advocate.**

8\. Here he breathes softly on them in the form of a cross, saying: **Receive, by this breath, the good Spirit along with His blessing.**

P: **Peace be with you.**

All: **And also with you.**

9\. Then the candidates pass in single file before the priest, who makes the sign of the cross on the brow and heart of each, saying: **N., receive the sign of the cross on your brow and on your heart. Put your whole trust in the heavenly teachings. And lead a life that will truly fit you to be a dwelling place for God. On entering God's Church acknowledge with joy that you have escaped the clutches of death.**

The priest continues: **Worship God the Father almighty, and Jesus Christ, His only-begotten Son, our Lord, who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire.**

All: Amen.

The priest then adds (using the singular forms when required): **Let us pray. I entreat you, blessed Lord and Father, almighty and everlasting God, to point out the way of truth and godly knowledge to these servants of yours who grope in uncertainty and doubt in the darkness of this world. Open their inner sight, the better to see you as the one God, the Father in the Son and the Son in the Father, in union with the Holy Spirit. May it be their good fortune to enjoy the fruit of this avowal both now and forevermore; through Christ our Lord.**

All: **Amen.**

10\. After this the candidates pass again in single file before the priest, who traces the sign of the cross with his thumb on the brow of each, saying: **I sign you on the brow that you may take up the cross of our Lord.**

On the ears: **I sign you on the ears that you may listen to the heavenly teachings.**

On the eyes: **I sign you on the eyes that you may see the grandeur of God.**

On the nostrils: **I sign you on the nostrils that you may sense the sweet fragrance of Christ.**

On the mouth: **I sign you on the mouth that you may proclaim the word of life.**

On the breast: **I sign you on the breast that you may believe in God.**

On the shoulders: **I sign you on the shoulders that you may take on you the yoke of His service.**

Finally he makes one large sign of the cross over the elect, saying: **I sign all of you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, that you may come to your eternal destiny and have life without end.**

All: **Amen.**

Then he adds these two prayers (using the singular forms when required): **Let us pray. Lord, if it please you, hear our prayer, and by your inexhaustible power protect your chosen ones, N. and N., now marked with the sign of our Savior's holy cross. Let them treasure this first sharing of your sovereign glory, and by keeping your commandments deserve to attain the glory of heaven to which those born anew are destined; through Christ our Lord.**

All: Amen.

P: **Let us pray. God, who first made the human race and then fashioned it anew, show your mercy to the people you are to adopt, and by the New Covenant add them as new offspring to your family. Thus, as children of the promise, may they delight in having become by grace what they could not have aspired to by nature; through Christ our Lord.**

All: **Amen.**

11\. Then the priest holds his hand outstretched over them and says (using the singular forms when required): **Let us pray. Almighty everlasting God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, look with favor on your servants whom it has pleased you to call to this first step in the faith. Rid them of all inward blindness. Sever all snares of Satan which heretofore bound them. Open wide for them, Lord, the door to your fatherly love. May the seal of your wisdom so penetrate them, as to cast out all tainted and foul inclinations, and let in the fragrance of your lofty teachings. Thus shall they serve you gladly in your Church and grow daily more perfect. And once they have tasted the medicinal property of salt, may they be fit to approach the grace of your baptism;[2] through Christ our Lord.**

All: **Amen.**

12\. In conclusion the priest says: **Go in peace and may the Lord be with you.**

All: **Amen.**

## Second stage

13\. The priest, vested in surplice and purple stole or even a cope of the same color, comes to the altar steps with his assistants. He kneels and implores God's help, after which he rises, signs himself with the cross, and says:

P: **God, come to my rescue.**

All: **Lord, make haste to help me.**

P: **Glory be to the Father.**

All: **As it was in the beginning.**

14\. The priest blesses salt with this exorcism: **God's creature, salt, I cast out the demon from you, in the name of God the Father almighty, in the love of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the strength of the Holy Spirit. I purify you by the living God, the true God, the holy God, by God who created you to be a preservative for mankind, and ordered you to be sanctified by His ministers for the benefit of the people who are about to embrace the faith. In the name of the Blessed Trinity may you become a saving sign empowered to drive away the enemy. Therefore, we beg you, Lord, our God, to sanctify and to bless this creature, salt, thus providing a perfect remedy for all who receive it, one that will permeate their inmost being. We ask this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire.**

All: **Amen.**

Before giving the blessed salt to the catechumens the priest adds this prayer (using the singular forms when required): **Let us pray. Blessed Lord and Father, almighty and everlasting God, who is, who was, who ever shall be, whose beginning is unknown, whose end is inconceivable. We humbly implore you on behalf of these servants of yours whom you have freed from the shackles of error; graciously heed them as they bow low before you at the cleansing font where one is born over again by water and the Holy Spirit. May they put off the old man and put on the new man created in your image; may they receive the pure and spotless robe and thus become worthy of serving you, our God; through Christ our Lord.**

All: **Amen.**

15\. Taking a pinch of blessed salt he puts it in the mouth of each catechumen, saying: **N., take this salt in sign of wisdom. May it be for you likewise a token that foreshadows everlasting life.**

Candidate: **Amen.**

P: **Peace be with you.**

Candidate: **And also with you.**

Then he adds this prayer (using the singular forms when required): **Let us pray. God of our fathers, God, source of all truth, we humbly ask you to be well disposed to your servants, N. and N. After this first taste of salt, let their hunger for heavenly nourishment not be prolonged but soon be satisfied. For then they will always pay homage to your holy name with fervor, joy, and trust. In your tender care, O Lord, lead them to the bath of water where one is born over again, so that taken into the family of your faithful they can finally attain the everlasting reward which you have promised; through Christ our Lord.**

All: **Amen.**

16. In conclusion the priest says:

P: **Go in peace and may the Lord be with you.**

All: **Amen.**

## Third stage

17\. It is left to the prudent judgment of the Ordinary whether the three following stages, i.e., the three series of exorcisms, are to be carried out independently and separately, or whether all three are to be combined into one action, or even whether only one of the three is to be used, omitting the other two.

18\. The ceremonies of this stage are always to take place with the men in a separate group and the same for the women; also if convenient at a different place or time.

19\. The priest, vested in surplice and purple stole or even a cope of the same color, comes to the altar steps with his assistants. He kneels and implores God's help, after which he rises, signs himself with the cross, and says:

The candidates stand up and say: **Amen.**

The priest says to the sponsors: **Mark them with the sign of the cross while I do likewise.**

The sponsors trace the sign of the cross on the candidates' brow with the thumb, whereas the priest makes the sign over them--both priest and sponsors saying the words: **In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.**

21\. When the candidates are men the priest says the following prayer holding his hand outstretched over them, and changing the plural forms to the singular when required: **Let us pray. God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, O God, who appeared to Moses, your servant, on Mt. Sinai, and led the children of Israel out of Egypt's land, appointing your good angel over them to guard them day and night; we beg you, Lord, if it please you, to send down your holy angel from heaven to guard these servants of yours in like manner, and to lead them to the grace of your baptism; through Christ our Lord.**

All: **Amen.**

The priest then pronounces the exorcism over them, changing the plural forms to the singular when required: **Now, foul fiend, recall the curse that decided your fate once for all. Indeed, pay homage to the living and true God, pay homage to Jesus Christ, His Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Keep far from these servants of God, for Jesus Christ, our Lord and God, has freely called them to His holy grace and blessed way and to the waters of baptism.**

The priest makes the sign of the cross over them, while the candidates sign themselves on the brow with the thumb; the priest says: **Never dare, accursed fiend, to desecrate this seal of the holy cross which we imprint on their brow; through Christ our Lord, who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire.**

God of heaven and earth, God of the angels and archangels, God of the patriarchs and prophets, God of the apostles and martyrs, God of the confessors and virgins, God of all the devout; God whom every tongue praises and before whom all bend the knee, in heaven, on earth, and in the depths; I call on you, Lord, to watch over these servants of yours in like manner, and to lead them in your kindness to the grace of your baptism; through Christ our Lord.**
All: Amen.

Using the singular forms when required:

**Now, foul fiend, recall the curse that decided your fate once for all. Indeed, pay homage to the living and true God, pay homage to Jesus Christ, His Son, and to the Holy Spirit.

Claim them as your own, you who have graciously promised: "Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you." Reach out the reward to them who ask, open wide the door to them who knock. For then will they attain the everlasting blessing of heavenly cleansing, and possess the kingdom which in your bounty you have promised; through Christ our Lord.**

All: **Amen.**

The priest then pronounces the exorcism over them (using the singular forms when required): **Hear, accursed Satan, for I adjure you in the name of the infinite God and His Son, Jesus Christ, our Savior, to flee in trembling and groaning, for you and your envy are vanquished. May you have nothing in common with these servants of God, whose thoughts are already of heaven, and who are determined to renounce both you and your world and to overcome you and so win a blessed and immortal reward. Pay homage, then, to the Holy Spirit, who now approaches from heaven's high citadel to frustrate your wicked designs, and to prepare their hearts, once they are purified in the grace-laden waters, as a sanctified dwelling for God. And so will these servants of the Most High, delivered from guilt of past crimes, render endless thanks to the everlasting God and laud His holy name forevermore.**

## Sixth stage

41\. At the appointed time the catechumens assemble at the church door, or at another place outside the edifice, from where they will march in solemn procession to the church.

The first candidate with left hand holds onto the right hand of the second, the second of the third, etc. In doing so the priest says: **Come into God's holy sanctuary to receive a heavenly blessing from our Lord Jesus Christ and to be united with Him and His saints.**

All: **Amen.**

43\. Having come into the church the elect lie prostrate on the floor-- all at the same time--and spend a few moments in adoration.

## At the gates 

44\. Then at a signal they rise together; the priest then holds his hand outstretched over their heads as they join with him in reciting the Apostles' Creed and the Lord's Prayer:

All: **I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell; the third day He arose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; from there He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.**

**Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.**

45\. Standing with his back turned to the gates of the baptistery, the priest again holds his hand outstretched over the heads of the elect, and says (using the singular forms when required):

**Surely it is no secret to you, Satan, that punishment is your lot, torments your portion, that the day of judgment threatens you, that day of never ending torture, the day that shall be like a flaming furnace, in the midst of which everlasting perdition awaits you and your apostate angels. Therefore, accursed one, deservedly doomed, pay homage to the living and true God, pay homage to Jesus Christ, His Son, and to the Holy Spirit, the Advocate. In His name and power I command you, unclean spirit whoever you are, begone and stay far away from these servants of God. For today Jesus Christ, our Lord and God, freely calls them to His holy grace and blessed way and to the waters of baptism, where they will become God's dwelling by the water of rebirth that gives full remission of sin We ask this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire.**

All: **Amen.**

46\. The priest then moistens his thumb with his spittle and touches the ears and nostrils of the person (each one). The use of saliva may be omitted for reasons of hygiene, when there is fear of contracting or communicating disease. But the ceremony itself is not omitted. He touches first the right ear then the left, saying:
**Ephpheta, which means: Be opened.**

Next touching the nostrils he adds: **And perceive the fragrance of God's loving ways. But you, evil spirit, begone, for the judgment of God has come.**

47\. Next the priest calls the candidates by their full name, first the men then the women, and each one answers: **Present.**

Afterward he puts these questions to them:

P: **Do you renounce Satan?**

All: **I do renounce him.**

P: **And all his works?**

All: **I do renounce them.**

P: **And all his attractions?**

All: **I do renounce them.**

48\. Then the candidates pass in single file before the priest, who dips his thumb in the holy oil of catechumens and anoints each one in the form of a cross, first on the breast then on the back between the shoulders, pronouncing only once these words: **I anoint you with the oil that sanctifies in Christ Jesus our Lord, that you may have everlasting life.**

All: **Amen.**

P: **Peace be with you.**

All: **And also with you.**

And then he goes on with the exorcism as given above. Or the ceremony may also be performed in one action for the whole group.

49\. Afterward he wipes his thumb and the spots anointed with cotton or similar material. He then adds the following: **Go out, unclean spirit, and pay homage to the living and true God. Depart, unclean spirit, and give place to Jesus Christ, His Son. Stay far away, unclean spirit, and give place to the Holy Spirit, the Advocate. If the number of catechumens is large there is no objection to having these ceremonies performed by several priests.**

50\. In conclusion the priest says: **Go in peace, and may the Lord be with you.**

All: **Amen.**

## Seventh stage

51\. The elect are assembled at the baptismal font. The priest, vested in surplice and purple stole or even a cope of the same color, comes to the altar steps with his assistants. He kneels and implores God's help. after which he rises, signs himself with the cross, and says:

P: **God, come to my rescue.**

All: **Lord, make haste to help me.**

P: **Glory be to the Father.**

All: **As it was in the beginning.**

52\. Next the priest calls the elect by their full name, and each one answers: **Present**. 

Afterward he puts these questions to them:

P: **Do you believe in God the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth?**

All: **I do believe.**

P: **Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was born into this world and suffered for us?**

All: **I do believe.**

P: **And do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?**

All: **I do believe.**

P: **Do you wish to be baptized?**

All: **I do.**

53\. The candidate at this moment is bareheaded and has his clothing loosened at the neck. As the godfather or godmother (or both if two sponsors are used) take hold of or touch the candidate, the latter bends down over the font, and the priest takes baptismal water with a ladle, pours it thrice in the form of a cross on the head of the candidate, and baptizes him in the name of the Blessed Trinity, saying: **N., I baptize you in the name of the Father,** (here he pours the first time) **and of the Son,** (pouring a second time) **and of the Holy Spirit** (pouring a third time).

54\. If the water which runs off the head of the baptized cannot fall into the sacrarium of the baptistery, it should be caught in a basin provided for that purpose and later thrown into the sacrarium. If several are being baptized each one has the ceremony administered to him in the manner described above; and if there are both men and women the men are baptized first, followed by the women.

If there is doubt whether the person has already been baptized, the following form is used: **N., if you are not baptized, I baptize you,** etc.

55\. The priest dips his thumb in holy chrism (if convenient he may be assisted here by another priest or several others, also vested in surplice and white stole), and in the form of a cross anoints the person on the crown of the head, saying: **The almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, has caused you to be born over again of water and the Holy Spirit and pardoned you all your sins. May he now anoint you with the chrism that sanctifies in Christ Jesus our Lord, and bring you to everlasting life.**

All: **Amen.**

P: **Peace be with you.**

All: **And also with you.**

56\. When all have been anointed with holy chrism (or blessed as directed in no. 55a), the priest wipes his thumb with cotton or something similar. Now the sponsors give the white robe to their respective godchild as the priest says: **Take this white robe and keep it spotless until you arrive at the judgment seat of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you may be rewarded with everlasting life.**

All: **Amen.**

And the baptized are now vested in the new white robes, removing if necessary some of their outer clothing.

57\. Next the godparents place a lighted taper or candle in the right hand of their respective godchild as the priest says: **Take this burning candle as a reminder to keep your baptismal innocence. Obey God's commandments, so that when our Lord comes for the joyous wedding feast you may go forth to meet Him with all the saints in the halls of heaven, and be happy with Him forevermore.**

All: **Amen.**

The baptized hold the lighted candle till the end, except while being confirmed.

58\. In conclusion the priest says: **Go in peace, and may the Lord be with you.**

All: **Amen.**
